## Milestone 1 feedback
Nice work - your directory structure is to spec, and your HTML looks great. Nice job outlining an appropriate persona and use case for your chosen purpose/audience/goal. +1 for good git commit hygene :D

Your Milestone 1 passes at [Tier III](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/) - nice job! You're clear to begin work on [Milestone 2&alpha;](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/milestone-two/) 

### Edits &amp; Suggestions
- Best to place your final paragraph inside a &lt;p&gt; tag.

## Milestone 2 feedback
Very well done you perfectly laid out what exactly you want to accomplish with your project. The goals you set out should be very easy to accomplish. Make sure the photo you chose as your background does not overpower the content of the website. 

Im a little curious what will be in your navagation bar other than your name? Also how exactly do you plan on laying out your portfolio section will you hard wire the pictures and links for your portfolio, or will you be using some type of tool like html slides or swipe box? 

Feel free to start working on your pwp whenever you want but remember we still need to cover Bootstrap in class. If you wanna get an early jump on milestone 2b here is the links to the documentation needed http://getbootstrap.com/ and https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/class-materials/bootstrap/
