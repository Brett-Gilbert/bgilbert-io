## Milestone 1 feedback
Nice work - your directory structure is to spec, and your HTML looks great. Nice job outlining an appropriate persona and use case for your chosen purpose/audience/goal. +1 for good git commit hygene :D

Your Milestone 1 passes at [Tier III](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/) - nice job! You're clear to begin work on [Milestone 2&alpha;](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/milestone-two/) 

### Edits &amp; Suggestions
- Best to place your final paragraph inside a &lt;p&gt; tag.
