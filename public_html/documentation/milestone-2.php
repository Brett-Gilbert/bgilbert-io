		<h2>Content Strategy</h2>
		<p>My site will be a single page and consist of the following sections</p>
		<h3>Welcome</h3>
		<p>This will be a brief, 1 line message welcoming visitors to my website and explaining its purpose. It will be overlaid on a picture of the Sandia Mountains or something like that which will be the persistent background for the entire page.</p>
		<h3>About Me</h3>
		<p>This section will contain a photo of me and a couple of paragraphs about who I am.</p>
		<h3>Portfolio</h3>
		<p>This section will contain links in the form of screenshots to some of my work and include a short blurb about each site.</p>
		<h3>Contact Me</h3>
		<p>This section will contain a short form that can be filled out in order to contact me via email. It will also contain a Linkedin icon at the bottom that will redirect the user to my Linkedin profile.</p>
